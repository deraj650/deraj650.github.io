## Winds for Change - Future Leaders [cite: 1]

The **Rajasthan Leaders Association (RLA)** is driven by a vision to improve society by developing the leadership potential of Rajasthani young minds[cite: 2, 35]. We are creating a sustainable platform for youth from Rajasthan to promote culture, social values, and knowledge for future leadership[cite: 3, 36].

**Our Philosophy: "Giving Back to Society"** [cite: 4, 37]

**Our Motto: "Together We Rise"** [cite: 6, 32, 39]

### Addressing the Needs of Youth

We recognize the challenges faced by young minds, including lack of career awareness and readiness for the workforce[cite: 22, 44, 46, 47, 48, 51]. RLA aims to empower youth to overcome these obstacles and realize their full potential[cite: 8, 52].
